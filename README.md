# Who I Am

Hi, I'm Ian. You may also know me as Zac (short for Isaac).

I am a software developer, primarily engaged in web development.

I've worked mainly in health-tech, where I previously developed comprehensive
health facility management systems (along with a small core team of developers),
which is being used to serve over a million patients across the Philippines.

I come from a physics background, having studied it in my undergrad. I've since
been developing software, with a knack for technical complexity and the cutting
edge.

My analytical nature, combined with a natural yearning to make complex systems
simple and elegant, allows me to work with deeply technical concepts and turn
them into products for the everyday user.

# What I Love

I am a **web developer**. I enjoy working with React. I work professionally with
Vue, Node.js, and MongoDB, among others.

**Vim** is my text editor of choice. Check out my [Vim dotfiles](https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config)
for starters, or browse [my repositories](https://github.com/igemnace?tab=repositories)
to find some of the stand-alone plugins I've authored.

I use **Linux** as my main operating system. I enjoy working in my terminal. I
prefer keyboard-driven software in general. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/igemnace/dotfiles)!

I love **open-source**. Most of my daily drivers are open-source software. I
also author my own open-source contributions. Find them here, on Github!

I love **physics**. I love understanding the universe on a theoretical level. My
undergraduate studies were in Applied Physics. I enjoy browsing [the Physics Stack Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/)
for brain-tickling discussion.

I enjoy **discussion about software**. Catch me on IRC: igemnace on [libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat).
I frequent the following channels:

- #vim
- #archlinux
- #bash
- #emacs
- #node.js
- #commonlisp
- #git
- #sr.ht
