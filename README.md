I am a **web developer**. I enjoy working with React. I work professionally with
Vue, Node.js, and MongoDB, among others.

**Vim** is my text editor of choice. Check out my [Vim dotfiles](https://github.com/igemnace/vim-config)
for starters, or browse [my repositories](https://github.com/igemnace?tab=repositories)
to find some of the stand-alone plugins I've authored.

I use **Linux** as my main operating system. I enjoy working in my terminal. I
prefer keyboard-driven software in general. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/igemnace/dotfiles)!

I love **open-source**. Most of my daily drivers are open-source software. I
also author my own open-source contributions. Find them here on Github, or on
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~igemnace)!

I love **physics**. I love understanding the universe on a theoretical level. My
undergraduate studies were in Applied Physics. I enjoy browsing [the Physics Stack Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/)
for brain-tickling discussion.

I enjoy **discussion about software**. Catch me on IRC: igemnace on [libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat).
